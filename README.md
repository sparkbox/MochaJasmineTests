**Install**

    npm install

**Directory Structure**

The specs are contained within the specs directory, following the server/client model:

    <yourproject>/specs/client
    <yourproject>/specs/server

The source file are located in the following directories:

    <yourproject>/src/client/js
    <yourproject>/src/server

**Running Tests**

Now we have Jasmine running our client side specs, and we have Mocha (CLI) running our server side specs. You can use grunt watch to track your files for changes, and re-run the tasks specified in the Gruntfile.js

    grunt watch
